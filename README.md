This course was prepared for the Nanohacker community

    $ git clone https://github.com/deepdeepdot/deep-nano-draft.git
    $ cd deep-nano-draft


If you have python 2.7

    $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer


If you have python 3

    $ python -m http.server


### Overview

It requires proficiency in a programming language, say Ruby or Javascript.
We'll cover some computer science topics like trees, functional 
programming using Python, uses of classes.

Prerequisites
* Experience with programming
* Full stack web development

* Math concepts: matrix, functions, basic stats
* Programming with Python: images, plotting functions
* Intro to deep learning concepts
* Neural Networks: NN, CNN, RNN
* Overview of popular APIs
    - tensorflow, keras, pytorch
* Deep Learning with Javascript
    - ml5.js, magenta.js, tensorflow.js

I decided not to recreate slides that have been wonderfully created by other free online courses. And also reuse much of the available online material on the net.
